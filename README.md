# seattle-breweries

An app that showcases the many breweries in Seattle, WA. 

The original was one of my first apps created using vanilla JS. You can find the original code in the 'original' directory.

The updated React version of this app is in the 'seattle-breweries' directory. To launch this app, first you will have to spin up the mock server using 'json-server ./original/db.json -w', then navigate into the 'seattle-breweries' directory and run 'yarn start' from the terminal.
